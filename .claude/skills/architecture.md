## Terminology (Post-Rename V3)

Code, DB, and UI all use the same terms now — no remapping layer needed. `HL_Label_Remap` has been removed from code.

## WordPress Roles vs Cycle Roles (Critical Architecture Decision)

HL Core creates ONE custom WP role: **Coach** (with `read`, `manage_hl_core`, `hl_view_enrollments`). Administrators get `manage_hl_core` capability added.

**ALL cycle-specific roles** (teacher, mentor, school_leader, district_leader) are stored in the `hl_enrollment.roles` JSON column — NOT as WordPress roles. This is by design:

| Who | WP Role | HL Core Identification |
|---|---|---|
| Teachers, Mentors, Leaders | `subscriber` (or any basic WP role) | `hl_enrollment.roles` JSON per cycle |
| Housman Coaches | `coach` (custom WP role) | `manage_hl_core` capability |
| Housman Admins | `administrator` | `manage_hl_core` capability |

**Why:** A user can be a teacher in one cycle and a mentor in another. WP roles are global; enrollment roles are per-cycle. The BuddyBoss sidebar, front-end pages, and scope filtering all use enrollment roles from `hl_enrollment`, not WP roles.

Some legacy WP roles exist (`school_district`, `teacher`, `mentor`, `school_leader`) from old Elementor pages — HL Core does NOT use these.

## Coach Assignment Architecture

Coaches are assigned at three scope levels with "most specific wins" resolution:

1. **School level** — coach is default for all enrollments at that school
2. **Team level** — overrides school assignment for team members
3. **Enrollment level** — overrides everything for a specific participant

Stored in `hl_coach_assignment` table with `effective_from`/`effective_to` dates. Reassignment closes the old record and creates a new one — full history preserved. Coaching sessions retain the original `coach_user_id` (frozen at time of session).

See doc 10 §13-14 for full spec.

## Cycle Entity

A Cycle is a time-bounded yearly run within a Partnership. It is the primary operational entity — enrollments, teams, pathways, components, and assessments all belong to a Cycle.

**Key properties:**
- Stored in `hl_cycle` table (cycle_id, cycle_uuid, partnership_id, cycle_name, cycle_code, cycle_type, district_id, is_control_group, status, start_date, end_date)
- Partnership is the parent container: `hl_cycle.partnership_id` → `hl_partnership`
- Pathways belong to Cycle: `hl_pathway.cycle_id` → `hl_cycle`
- Enrollment stays at Cycle level
- Teams also stay at Cycle level

## Cycle Types

`hl_cycle.cycle_type` distinguishes complexity levels:

| Type | Usage | Complexity |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `program` | B2E Mastery and similar multi-year programs | Full: Pathways, Teams, Coaching, Assessments |
| `course` | Institutional short course purchases | Minimal: auto-created single Pathway + Component |

Course-type Cycles hide: Teams tab, Coaching tab, Assessment tabs, Pathway editor.

## Course Catalog (Multilingual Course Mapping)

`hl_course_catalog` maps logical courses (e.g., TC1, MC3) to their EN/ES/PT LearnDash course variants. One catalog entry = one component = one completion state, regardless of which language the user completes.

**Key classes:** `HL_Course_Catalog` (domain model, `resolve_ld_course_id()` static helper), `HL_Course_Catalog_Repository` (CRUD + reverse lookup + duplicate detection), `HL_Admin_Course_Catalog` (admin CRUD page with AJAX LD course search).

**Integration points:**
- **Routing:** `HL_Pathway_Routing_Service::$stages` uses `catalog_codes` (not course IDs). Stage completion checks any language variant.
- **LD completion:** `on_course_completed()` does catalog-first lookup (by LD course ID → catalog_id → components), with `external_ref` fallback gated behind `hl_catalog_migration_complete` option.
- **Frontend:** `HL_Course_Catalog::resolve_ld_course_id($component, $enrollment)` resolves language-specific course link based on `$enrollment->language_preference`. Used in 7 call sites across 4 frontend files.
- **Import:** Optional `language` CSV column sets `hl_enrollment.language_preference`.
- **Reporting:** Component detail view uses catalog title (canonical English name).
- **Pathway admin:** Component form shows catalog dropdown with language badges (`[EN] [ES]`).

**Schema:** `catalog_code` (UNIQUE, stable key), `ld_course_en`/`ld_course_es`/`ld_course_pt` (UNIQUE, nullable — MySQL ignores NULLs in UNIQUE), `status` (active/archived). Schema revision 30.

## Individual Enrollments (PLANNED — Phase 33 in Build Queue)

For individual (non-institutional) course purchases. Stored in `hl_individual_enrollment` (user_id, course_id, enrolled_at, expires_at, status).

- Admin pages: Course List + Course Detail (under HL Core menu)
- Frontend: "My Courses" section on Dashboard for active individual enrollments
- Expiration enforcement: blocks access when expires_at < now
- Not related to Cycles — this is a separate, simpler enrollment path for standalone course access

## Scope Service (HL_Scope_Service)

Shared static helper used by ALL listing pages for role-based data filtering:
- Admin → sees all (no restriction)
- Coach → filtered by `hl_coach_assignment` cycle_ids + own enrollments
- District Leader → expands to all schools in their district
- School Leader → filtered to their school(s)
- Mentor → filtered to their team(s)
- Teacher → filtered to their own enrollment/assignments

Static cache per user_id per request. Convenience helpers: `can_view_cycle()`, `can_view_school()`, `has_role()`, `filter_by_ids()`.

## Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar menu is rendered programmatically by `HL_BuddyBoss_Integration::build_menu_items()` — NOT via WordPress Menus admin. 16 menu items with role-based visibility. Staff WITHOUT enrollment see only directory/management pages. Staff WITH enrollment see both. Coach-only users see coach tools but not staff tools. See code for full menu item list.

## Forms Architecture

HL Core uses **custom PHP** for all forms except legacy observations:
- **Teacher Self-Assessment** — Custom instrument system (`hl_teacher_assessment_instrument` JSON definitions). PRE = single-column, POST = dual-column retrospective.
- **Child Assessment** — Dynamic per-child matrix from roster + instrument. Grouped by `frozen_age_group`. AJAX draft auto-save.
- **Coaching Sessions** — Admin CRUD workflow.
- **Cross-pathway forms** — RP Notes, Action Plan, Self-Reflection, Classroom Visit (5 renderers, see below).
- **JFB (legacy, pending removal)** — Observations only. System checks `teacher_instrument_id` first (custom), falls back to `jfb_form_id`.

## Cross-Pathway Events

Cross-pathway events are activities that span multiple participants across a cycle, loosely coupled to the component/pathway system via `component_type` dispatch on the Component Page.

### 3 Event Types

| Event Type | component_type ENUM | Participants |
|---|---|---|
| **Reflective Practice Session** | `reflective_practice_session` | Mentor + Teacher |
| **Classroom Visit** | `classroom_visit` | Leader + Teacher |
| **Self-Reflection** | `self_reflection` | Teacher (solo) |

Events are loosely coupled to components: Component Page dispatches to the appropriate renderer based on `component_type`. Form submissions store `responses_json` with `instrument_id` reference. 5 DB tables (`hl_rp_session`, `hl_rp_session_submission`, `hl_classroom_visit`, `hl_classroom_visit_submission`, `hl_coaching_session_submission`). 3 services (`HL_RP_Session_Service`, `HL_Classroom_Visit_Service`, `HL_Session_Prep_Service`).

## Component Types (ENUM)

The `hl_component.component_type` ENUM defines all possible component types:

| Type | Usage | Frontend Renderer |
|---|---|---|
| `learndash_course` | LearnDash course completion | Redirects to LD course |
| `teacher_self_assessment` | Teacher self-assessment (PRE/POST) | `HL_Frontend_Teacher_Assessment` |
| `child_assessment` | Child assessment per classroom | `HL_Frontend_Child_Assessment` |
| `coaching_session_attendance` | Coaching session (managed by coach) | Managed-by-coach notice |
| `observation` | Mentor observation | `HL_Frontend_Observations` |
| `reflective_practice_session` | RP session (mentor+teacher forms) | `HL_Frontend_RP_Session` (role-based: mentor→RP Notes, teacher→Action Plan) |
| `classroom_visit` | Leader classroom visit | `HL_Frontend_Classroom_Visit` |
| `self_reflection` | Teacher self-reflection | `HL_Frontend_Self_Reflection` |

**Additional `hl_component` columns (beyond type/title/weight):**
- `complete_by` (date, nullable) — suggested completion date (not enforced, displayed on frontend)
- `requires_classroom` (tinyint, default 0) — eligibility: requires teaching assignment
- `eligible_roles` (text, JSON array or NULL) — eligibility: restricts to specific enrollment roles

## Component Eligibility Rules (Implemented)

Two columns on `hl_component` enable per-component eligibility filtering:
- **`requires_classroom`** (tinyint, default 0) — component requires the enrollee to have at least one `hl_teaching_assignment` record.
- **`eligible_roles`** (text, JSON array or NULL) — component is only for enrollees whose `hl_enrollment.roles` JSON contains at least one of the listed roles. NULL = all roles eligible.

`HL_Rules_Engine_Service::check_eligibility()` checks both conditions (AND logic). Ineligible components return `availability_status = 'not_applicable'`, are excluded from weighted completion averages (`compute_rollups()`), and show "Not Applicable" with grayed styling on all frontend pages (Program Page, My Progress, My Programs, User Profile, Team Progress, Dashboard).

Admin UI: "Eligibility Rules" section in the component form with checkbox for requires_classroom and checkboxes for eligible_roles.

## Cross-Pathway Instruments

6 instruments in `hl_teacher_assessment_instrument` (seeded by `setup-elcpb-y2-v2`): `coaching_rp_notes`, `mentoring_rp_notes`, `coaching_action_plan`, `mentoring_action_plan`, `classroom_visit_form`, `self_reflection_form`. Each contains `sections_json` rendered by 5 frontend renderers (`HL_Frontend_RP_Notes`, `HL_Frontend_Action_Plan`, `HL_Frontend_Self_Reflection`, `HL_Frontend_Classroom_Visit`, `HL_Frontend_RP_Session`). All custom PHP — no JFB.

## Control Group Research Design

### Purpose
Housman measures program impact by comparing:
- **Program cycles**: full B2E Mastery curriculum (courses, coaching, observations + assessments)
- **Control cycles**: assessment-only (Teacher Self-Assessment Pre/Post + Child Assessment Pre/Post)

### How it works
1. Create a **Partnership** (container, e.g., "B2E Mastery - Lutheran Services Florida")
2. Add the **program cycle** to the partnership
3. Create a **control cycle** (`is_control_group = true`) in the same partnership
4. Control cycle gets an assessment-only pathway (4 components: TSA Pre, CA Pre, TSA Post, CA Post)
5. POST components are time-gated via drip rules
6. **Comparison reports** appear in Admin Reports when selecting the Partnership filter

### UI/UX adaptations for control cycles:
- Purple "Control" badge in admin cycle list and editor
- Coaching and Teams tabs auto-hidden in admin and frontend
- Assessment-only pathway (no course or coaching components)

## Guided Tours System

In-app guided tours built on Driver.js (MIT, 1.4.0). 3 DB tables (`hl_tour`, `hl_tour_step`, `hl_tour_seen`). Trigger types: `first_login` (auto once), `page_visit` (auto on first visit), `manual_only` (topbar "?" dropdown). Role-based targeting, multi-page flows, interactive steps.

**Key classes:** `HL_Tour_Repository`, `HL_Tour_Service`, `HL_Admin_Tours` (Settings > Tours tab with List/Editor/Styles subtabs).
**Frontend:** `hl-tour.js` (Driver.js wrapper, multi-page state via localStorage), `hl-element-picker.js` (visual selector picker with "View as Role"), topbar "?" button with dropdown.
**Global styles:** `wp_options` key `hl_tour_styles` — tooltip colors, font sizes, button colors.
